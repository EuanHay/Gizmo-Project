# Gizmo-Project
A project to create an electro-mechanical version of the Infinite Jukebox by Paul Lamere

To use the code behind this project, run the 'Remixatron' script, adapted from Dave Rensin's work: https://github.com/drensin/Remixatron, and transfer the data files onto a Raspberry Pi.

'ButtonFunction.py' acts as the song selection menu, allowing the user to choose from 6 pre-selected songs.
'Song1.py' is the example code for one of the songs, controlling the hardware and music playback and allowing users to return to the song selection menu.
